# Welcome to the ReadMe for the Panda Zone!

The Panda Zone is a simple website built with one purpose: to serve up random red panda videos. During the workday, my wife and I communicate primarily through cute animal videos. A surefire hit is a red panda video, so as a present I built this site.

The site uses the youtube api to embed an iframe on the page. The button will direct the api to serve up a new video id. When the user reaches the end of the list (I've manually curated these videos), the list reshuffles and begins at the beginning again.
